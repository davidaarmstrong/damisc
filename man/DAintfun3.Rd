\title{Conditional Effects Plots for Interactions in Linear Models}
\description{Generates two conditional effects plots for two interacted continuous covariates in linear models.}
\usage{
DAintfun3(obj, varnames, varcov=NULL, name.stem = "cond_eff", 
    xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, plot.type = "screen")
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{A model object of class \code{lm}}
  \item{varnames}{A two-element character vector where each element is the name of a variable involved in a two-way interaction.}
  \item{varcov}{A variance-covariance matrix with which to calculate the conditional standard errors.  If \code{NULL}, it is calculated with \code{vcov(obj)}.}
  \item{name.stem}{A character string giving filename to which the appropriate extension will be appended}
  \item{xlab}{Optional vector of length two giving the x-labels for the two plots that are generated.  The first element of the vector corresponds to the figure plotting the conditional effect of the first variable in \code{varnames} given the second and the second element of the vector corresponds to the figure plotting the conditional effect of the second variable in \code{varnames} conditional on the first.}
  \item{ylab}{Optional vector of length two giving the y-labels for the two plots that are generated.  The first element of the vector corresponds to the figure plotting the conditional effect of the first variable in \code{varnames} given the second and the second element of the vector corresponds to the figure plotting the conditional effect of the second variable in \code{varnames} conditional on the first.}
  \item{plot.type}{One of \sQuote{pdf}, \sQuote{png}, \sQuote{eps} or \sQuote{screen}, where the one of the first three will produce two graphs starting with \code{name.stem} written to the appropriate file type and the third will produce graphical output on the screen.}
}
\details{
This function does the same thing as \code{\link{DAintfun2}}, but presents effects only at the mean of the conditioning variable and the mean +/- 1 standard deviation. }
\value{
\item{graphs}{Either a single graph is printed on the screen (using \code{par(mfrow=c(1,2))}) or two figures starting with \code{name.stem} are produced where each gives the conditional effect of one variable based on the values of another.}
